-- Revised Workflow (Oct. 14, 2019) --

1. Download logs from a particular task with `python getlogs.py <task_id>`. Logs are stored in logs/ directory.

2. Run ./statsrepl.sh to extract metrics from all replica sets logs in logs/ and compile them into one big CSV file, `csv/replica_sets.csv`. Run ./statssharding.sh to do the same for all sharding log files.

3. Run `Rscript hist.r csv/replica_sets.csv charts/replica_sets.pdf` to generate replica_sets histogram plot. Or run
`Rscript hist.r csv/sharding.csv charts/sharding.pdf` for sharding.

4. Run `Rscript stats.r csv/replica_sets.csv csv/replica_sets_summary.csv` to generate summary stats in `csv/replica_sets_summary.csv`. Or `Rscript stats.r csv/sharding.csv csv/sharding_summary.csv` for sharding.


# Generate a table suitable for JIRA based on summary stats CSV file.
cat csv/replica_sets_summary.csv | sed -E "s/,/|/g" | sed -E "s/^/|/" | sed -E "s/$/|/"


Folder Overview:
